For more information, refer to https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm. Influenza severity level is determined by combining three key markers of influenza activity and distribution: influenza-like illness, hospitalizations, and influenza positive test results reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. MDPH analyzes data on these markers weekly and classifies the severity using historical data collected during past influenza seasons. For more information about how the severity indicator is calculated refer to https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/classifies-flu-severity.htm."

Syndromic Surveillance	Type	This field categorizes the row of data as either ILI (influenza-like illness) or HOSP (hospitlazations associated with influenza). This is the type of syndromic data.	"Influenza Program, Division of Epidemiology, Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences, Massachusetts Department of Public Health."	"As part of the National Syndromic Surveillance Program, MDPH receives data from Emergency Departments (EDs) covering 100% of ED visits statewide. These data are used to track patient visits related to influenza by monitoring the diagnoses the patients receive (ICD-10 code). These data are available to MDPH in near real-time. This graph shows the percent of all ED visits which result in a patient hospitalized because of illness associated with influenza infection. Influenza-like illness (ILI) is defined as fever (temperature of 100 deg F or greater) in addition to cough and/or sore throat. Many more people are infected with influenza than are tested for influenza. ILI is used throughout the regular influenza season to help track influenza activity in individuals who are not tested, as trends in ILI have been shown to mirror influenza trends.  Ninety-three healthcare facilities called ‘sentinel sites’ report the number of patients they see with ILI each week during regular flu season to MDPH. Sentinel sites include provider offices, school health services, community health centers, urgent care centers, and emergency departments across MA. Data reported by emergency departments provide information about ED visits that include diagnostic codes (influenza diagnosis code) as well as terms indicative of ILI. The CDC uses trends from past years to determine a region-specific baseline rate of ILI visits, which for Massachusetts is 1.9%. A rate above this regional baseline indicates higher than normal levels of ILI in the state."
