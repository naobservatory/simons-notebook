Term or Abbreviation	Definition			
ILI	Influenza-like illness			
ILI visit	"Influenza-like illness (ILI) is defined as fever (temperature of 100 deg F or greater) in addition to cough and/or sore throat. Many more people are infected with influenza than are tested for influenza. ILI is used throughout the regular influenza season to help track influenza activity in individuals who are not tested, as trends in ILI have been shown to mirror influenza trends.  One hundred and five healthcare facilities called ‘sentinel sites’ report the number of patients they see with ILI each week during regular flu season to MDPH. Sentinel sites include provider offices, school health services, community health centers, urgent care centers, and emergency departments across MA. Data reported by emergency departments provide information about ED visits that include diagnostic codes (influenza diagnosis code) as well as terms indicative of ILI. The CDC uses trends from past years to determine a region-specific baseline rate of ILI visits, which for Massachusetts is 1.9%. A rate above this regional baseline indicates higher than normal levels of ILI in the state."			
Hospitalization	"As part of the National Syndromic Surveillance Program, MDPH receives data from Emergency Departments (EDs) covering 100% of ED visits statewide. These data are used to track patient visits related to influenza by monitoring the diagnoses the patients receive (ICD-10 code) and hospitalizations are those vists where the patient is admitted to the hospital."
